Load "Sparkling_Pixie_Dust.unity" for an example scene, or simply drag the required effect from the Prefab folder (in the Project window) into the Hierarchy window.

Three of the prefabs (those not ending in "_particles") have an additional control script to help demonstrate the effects; with these the particle effects follow the mouse pointer, plus are activated and deactivated with the left mouse button.

Have fun!
